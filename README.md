# Clinic DataBase Design 
Our team aims to design and build a relational database using Oracle SQL Developer for a modern clinic system. This database aims to integrate critical entities related to healthcare delivery and administration, serving as a centralized repository for managing appointments, patient information, billing, and post-visit details. By optimizing management operations and improving resource allocation, our database will act as the nerve center of the clinic reception desk, enhancing scheduling efficiency and overall operational effectiveness.

Our design approach prioritizes modularity and flexibility, anticipating rapid changes in medical technology and regulations. This ensures that the database can easily adapt to new healthcare practices, regulatory requirements, and technological advancements, enabling clinics to maintain long-term operational excellence. In the patient journey within the clinic, from appointment scheduling to billing and treatment, our database will streamline processes, enhance data accuracy, and facilitate seamless coordination between healthcare professionals, ultimately improving patient care and satisfaction.
